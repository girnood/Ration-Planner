/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Ration Planner App
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that each user can only access their own data.
 * @data_structure Data is organized hierarchically under `/userProfiles/{userId}`, with subcollections for `essentials`, `debts`, and `payments`.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disallowed. Write access is strictly controlled based on user ownership. Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's internal fields.
 * @denormalization The `userProfileId` is denormalized in the `EssentialItem`, `Debt` and `Payment` documents to create path-based ownership, simplifying security rules and improving performance.
